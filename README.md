# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
The Diabetes prediction dataset comprises medical and demographic data, alongside patients' diabetes status (positive or negative). It encompasses age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. Leveraging this dataset, machine learning models can be developed to forecast diabetes in patients based on their medical and demographic profiles. Such predictive models serve as valuable tools for healthcare professionals, aiding in the identification of individuals at risk of developing diabetes and enabling the formulation of personalized treatment plans. Moreover, the dataset offers researchers an opportunity to delve into the intricate relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of diabetes development. By exploring these associations, researchers can deepen their understanding of the disease's etiology and risk factors. Overall, the dataset serves as a multifaceted resource, facilitating both clinical decision-making and academic inquiry into diabetes prediction and prevention strategies.
